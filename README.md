3. Challenges & Solutions

Static Build Failures: Resolved NextRouter was not mounted errors during the build process by enforcing dynamic rendering (SSR) for the entire application, which solved the conflict between the client-side useRouter hook in the shared layout and Next.js's default static generation.

Checkout Race Condition: Fixed a bug where users were redirected to the homepage instead of the success page after checkout. The solution was to move the clearCart() action from the checkout page to the success page, ensuring it only executes after the navigation is complete.

Dependency Instability: Overcame initial project instability and build failures by downgrading core dependencies from experimental versions (e.g., Next.js 15, React 19) to the latest stable releases, ensuring a reliable development environment.
